Libraries need are numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, standard scaler from sklearn,
 SgdRegressor from sklearn, train test split, mean squared error, and r2 score from sklearn

Can tune the various parameters for model in the second cell at the top of the code

The bottom of the code shows first the RMSE and R^2 and then residual anaysis of our model on the trianing set.

Then the after the training output the code shows the RMSE and R^2 and then residual anaysis of our model on the test set.

lastly the information that we included for our logging details can be found that shows the parameters used, model equation,
 and RMSE and R^2 for training and test set.
